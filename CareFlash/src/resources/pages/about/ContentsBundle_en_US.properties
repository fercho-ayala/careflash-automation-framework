# ABOUT
about.heading2 = Inspiration behind CareFlash
about.paragraph = CareFlash is located in Austin, TX and was founded in 2006 by Jay Drayer out of an experience he had when a family member was diagnosed with a chronic health challenge where complications developed... culminating in several weeks in hospice and a death. Testifying to the ways positive transformation can be driven by tragic events, the experience that motivated Jay to depart his career in corporate finance surrounded the 9/11 tragedies in which he witnessed the second plane's impact on the World Trade Center while on his way to a 9:00 meeting that morning at 60 Wall St.
about.heading3 = What does CareFlash do?
about.paragraph2 = This is not another patient website that engages loved ones with nonstop updates, well wishes and always asking how they can help - but a complete approach that moves loved ones from sympathy to empathy... enabling them from near and far to more naturally and comfortably rally 'round - extending integrated care and strengthening outlook and peace of mind involving circumstances such as:
about.bullet = Illness
about.bullet2 = Injury
about.bullet3 = Childbirth
about.bullet4 = Aging
about.bullet5 = Cognitive decline
about.bullet6 = Behavioral challenge
about.bullet7 = Addiction recovery
about.bullet8 = Grief from a loss
about.paragraph3 = A CareCommunity is entirely (and quickly and easily) created and operated by the family and requires no education or training.
about.paragraph4 = CareFlash also partners with hundreds of providers nationwide - enhancing comprehensive care, reducing caregiver burnout, improving overall wellness and enhancing marketing as in this sample video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDt__PSfUjlY&feature=youtu.be
