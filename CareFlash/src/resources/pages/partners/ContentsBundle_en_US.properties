adelson.paragraph = Nathan Adelson Hospice (NAH) was founded 35 years ago following the death of Nathan Adelson, a beloved hospital administrator who cared deeply for his patients and employees. As a result of Mr. Adelson\u2019s lengthy, painful battle with stomach cancer, his friends and loved ones realized the need for healthcare specific to pain management, responding to that need by founding NAH as Southern Nevada\u2019s first home care hospice.
adelson.paragraph2 = Nationally recognized today, as an industry leader with a reputation for providing exceptional end-of-life care, Nathan Adelson Hospice is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations. In 1983 NAH opened the area\u2019s first inpatient hospice and in 1999, a second facility - now offering a total of 38 inpatient beds.

nxstage.paragraph = What's The Big Deal About More Frequent Home Hemodialysis?
nxstage.paragraph2 = Home hemodialysis is a different way of doing hemodialysis. Instead of having to go to a dialysis center 3 times a week for treatments that are about 4 hours long, a person doing home hemodialysis does his or her treatments at home. There are different types and schedules of home hemodialysis, but the most common is more frequent home hemodialysis, in which the patient does shorter treatments (about 2.5 to 3 hours) more often (5 or 6 days per week) at home.  More frequent dialysis keeps the amount of toxin and water build-up to a minimum, which makes the treatment shorter and may reduce or eliminate many side effects patients experience.
