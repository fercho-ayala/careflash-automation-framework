#Tour2
tour2.heading2 = It's fast & easy to create your own free, secure CareCommunity to engage loved ones
tour2.paragraph = A CareCommunity is 100% invitation-only... allowing you to select exactly who you want to participate in what's going on with you or your loved ones.
tour2.paragraph2 = As you will see, members naturally and comfortably rally around without the typical awkwardness - and without waiting and hoping for ways to engage via the trickle-down effect of the grapevine.
tour2.paragraph3 = Each CareCommunity is built around its own Blog - not only for updates, well-wishes and discussions - but also for meaningful, in-depth, sustained dialogues that create huge healing power.

#Tour3
tour3.heading2 = Have you ever wondered why loved ones keep asking how they can help?
tour3.paragraph = People want to help, but don't know how, when or where - or what's most needed.  And no one wants to intrude.
tour3.paragraph2 = These are the reasons loved ones keep asking how they can help.
tour3.paragraph3 = The iHelp Calendar included in each private CareCommunity makes it a snap to coordinate caretaker's helpers.  Unobtrusively enlist helpers by posting tasks such as meal delivery.  You can share all the details, and members can volunteer to assist, all in the iHelp Calendar!  iHelp will also send email alerts to your members when new items are posted.
tour3.paragraph4 = iHelp is also an excellent way to enhance outlook and optimism - as simply as in offering or organizing a coffee, a walk in the park or a movie night.  Each represents huge healing power.
tour3.paragraph5 = iHelp effortlessly gets everyone on the same page, organized and moving the same direction!  Without all the hassles that are so common.
tour3.paragraph6 = This also applies to help with meds, therapies and appointments - helping keep the path to recovery on schedule!

#Tour4
tour4.heading2 = Social Storytelling celebrates life using loved ones' photos and in their own voices
tour4.paragraph = Since 'celebrating life' is such a tired ole saying, we named our newest module Social Storytelling.  It has nothing to do with well-wishes or messages of concern - nor is it a bunch of photos put to music.
tour4.paragraph2 = Social storytelling is an interactive, collaborative approach to telling the life story of the person at the heart of that CareCommunity - through the photos and in the voices of those loved ones - chapter by chapter sharing healing stories celebrating that life.
tour4.paragraph3 = Through converting member's shared experiences, memories and voices creates sustainable goodwill - providing benefit for many years and even generations to come.

#Tour5
tour5.heading2 = Smiling faces of loved ones brighten the day and foster better outlook
